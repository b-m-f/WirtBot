Debian: sudo apt-get install wireguard wireguard-tools Arch Linux: sudo pacman -S wireguard-tools Now copy the config that you downloaded to /etc/wireguard. You will need sudo for this operation, as the /etc/wireguard directory is protected.
To test things out run sudo wg-quick@DeviceName. wg-quick will automatically check the /etc/wireguard directory for the correct config, in this cast DeviceName.conf.
The connection should be established. You can check this with sudo wg.</description></item><item><title>Join with Windows</title><link>https://wirtbot.com/docs/common/join-a-network/windows/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wirtbot.com/docs/common/join-a-network/windows/</guid><description>Windows First download the WireGuardÂ® software from https://wireguard.com
