## Features

- Automatic generation of WireGuard configurations, including keys, directly in the browser
- Every configuration in the network is kept updated on changes
- If configured, all configurations will automatically be sent to the [WirtBot](https://github.com/b-m-f/wirt/WirtBot)
- WirtBot then automatically applies the configuration and immediately activates it
- Export and Import feature to keep track of multiple networks and generate Backups
- Automatic state retention in local storage
- Absolutely no tracking, each application is unique to a users browser
- Communication is guaranteed to only be between linked Interface and WirtBot by cryptographic signatures
