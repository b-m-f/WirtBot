# WirtBot documentation

This directory houses the [WirtBot website](https://wirtbot.com)

Feel free to contribute to it if you think something is missing or you have a great tutorial!

## Contributing

First of all download this repository.
Now create a new [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) file in the docs folder.
When you are satisfied with your page add it to the sidebar in `documentation/.vuepress/config.js`.

Everything is based on [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), which has great documentation and is beginner friendly.

### Test your changes

You will need:
- nodejs
- npm

After you have both installed run `npm install` in the root of this documentation repository.
To start a local development server run `npm run dev:docs`.

You local version will now be available at `http://localhost:9090`

### Submit your changes

When you are done open a [Pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#pull-request) and target it to the development branch! Once it is reviewed and everything looks good it will be merged and soon appear on the website.

If you need any help simply open an issue!
