# Archiving time

WirtBot is feature complete and I do not plan to add any new features to it.

As the stack should be resilient enough I will also start archiving the GitHub repository.

## Why?

My focus for things going forward will be on tooling for automated setups instead of UI's.
If you are interested you can check out my personal blog [ehlers.berlin](https://ehlers.berlin) (RSS: https://ehlers.berlin/blog/index.xml) to be updated.

I hope that the WirtBot project helped you to get your Homelab connected to the Internet securely.

Happy hacking,
