# WirtBot v3.9.0

Wow, 2 updates in such a short time.
Thanks to another project I currently work on WirtBot gets some new functionality.

## Additonal Names

It is now possible to add additional names to a device which will then be used to create more entries in the DNS config for that device.
This is useful if you would like to use subdomains for a reverse proxy for example.

On top of that there is now a name validation in place to make sure that no 1 name points to multiple devices in the network.

## Tests

The tests should be more robust due to a new way of waiting for correct requests to be fired from the browser before continuing a test execution.


Hopefully this is it for quite a while!

Maybe Ill see you on the new project, which I will announce here as well.
