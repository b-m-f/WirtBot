# 8.11.20

The `wirt-installer` is now `wirtbot-installer` on your computer and will look for the `wirtbot-installer.config.json` file to load previously input settings.

If you come from a version before 1.4.4 please rename you old `wirt-installer.config.json` to `wirtbot-installer.config.json` before updating your server to avoid repeating all your info.
