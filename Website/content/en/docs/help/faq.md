## Is my WirtBot secure when exposed?

By design yes. The WirtBot only accepts payloads from the Interface that are signed with the trusted public key.

But there might always be Bugs in the Source Code, so if you want to make sure that you are as secure as possible follow the setup guide for achieving extra security.

## I need a new feature in WirtBot

New features can be discussed on [Github](https://github.com/b-m-f/WirtBot).
Please note that WirtBot is in maintenance mode and will only include features that fit the core project scope of easily maintaining a WireGuard network.

### OK feature request

WireGuard gets a new feature and WirtBot does not yet support it

### Not Ok

OpenVPN support in WirtBot
