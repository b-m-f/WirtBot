# WirtBot v3.1

A small update is being released as I am writing this.

Version 3.1 tries to remove some clutter on the Dashboard.

From now on all advanced device options are hidden behind a `More` button.
The QR code for mobile devices is now also a button click away instead of always being displayed.

A small new feature was introduced as well. You can now add a Port to the device configuration settings. Whether or not all the clients you use need/support this feature should be checked first. It is mostly unnecessary unless you work with servers in a restricted network.

So far, happy hacking.
