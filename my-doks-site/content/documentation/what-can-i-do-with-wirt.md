## What can I do with a WirtBot?

Ever wanted to run your own cloud at home, where the data is on **your** harddrive but still available to you anywhere in the world?
No problem.

Want to collect data from your IOT project securely onto your server back home?
No problem.

Want to have secure **DNS** on all your devices?
No problem.

As you can see WirtBot allows you to realize projects that need secure communication over the internet.
But only up to a certain scale. The focus is to stay to true to the people and help beginners and experts alike.

In the future I hope to add a few tutorials on the amazing things that my WirtBot enables me to do.
And if you have got a use case, I'd love to hear about it, and maybe we can add a blog/showcases to this website together?
