## Linux

First install Wireguard:

- Debian: `sudo apt-get install wireguard wireguard-tools`
- Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S wireguard-tools`

Now copy the config that you downloaded to `/etc/wireguard`. You will need **sudo** for this operation, as the `/etc/wireguard` directory is protected.

To test things out run `sudo wg-quick@DeviceName`. **wg-quick** will automatically check the `/etc/wireguard` directory for the correct config, in this cast `DeviceName.conf`.

The connection should be established. You can check this with `sudo wg`.

### Making the connection permanent

If you want to stay connected you can enable this via `systemctl`.

Typing `sudo systemctl enabled --now wg-quick@DeviceName` will start a system service that will establish the connection on every reboot - if your system is using **SystemD**.
